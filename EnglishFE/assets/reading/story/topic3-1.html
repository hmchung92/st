<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Nothing but the truth!</h2>
<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 
David Casstevens of the Dallas Morning News tells a story about Frank Szymanski, a Notre Dame center in the 1940s, who had been called as a witness in a civil suit at South Bend.
<br/><br/>
"Are you on the Notre Dame football team this year?" the judge asked.
<br/><br/>
"Yes, Your Honor."
<br/><br/>
"What position?"
<br/><br/>
"Center, Your Honor."
<br/><br/>
"How good a center?"
<br/><br/>
Szymanski squirmed in his seat, but said firmly:
<br/><br/>
"Sir, I'm the best center Notre Dame has ever had."
<br/><br/>
Coach Frank Leahy, who was in the courtroom, was surprised. Szymanski always had been modest and unassuming. So when the proceedings were over, he took Szymanski aside and asked why he had made such a statement. Szymanski blushed.
<br/><br/>
"I hated to do it, Coach," he said. "But, after all, I was under oath."
<br/><br/>

The truth simply is, that's all. It doesn't need reasons; it doesn't have to be right: It's just the truth.

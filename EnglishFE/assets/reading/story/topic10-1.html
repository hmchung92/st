<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">7 Wonders</h2>
<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 
A group of students was asked to list what they thought were the present Seven Wonders of the World. Though there was some disagreement, the following got the most votes:
<br/><br/>
1. Egypt's Great Pyramids
2. Taj Mahal
3. Grand Canyon
4. Panama Canal
5. Empire State Building
6. St. Peter's Basilica
7. China's Great Wall
<br/><br/>
While gathering the votes, the teacher noted that one quiet student hadn't turned in her paper yet. So she asked the girl if she was having trouble with her list.
<br/><br/>
The girl replied, "Yes, a little. I couldn't quite make up my mind
because there were so many."
<br/><br/>
The teacher said, "Well, tell us what you have, and maybe we can help." The girl hesitated, then read, "I think the Seven Wonders of the World are:
<br/><br/>
1. to touch
2. to taste
3. to see
4. to hear
<br/><br/>
She hesitated a little, and then added
<br/><br/>
5. to feel
6. to laugh!
7. and to love
<br/><br/>
The room was so full of silence you could have heard a pin drop. Those things we overlook as simple and "ordinary" are truly wondrous. A gentle reminder that the most precious things are before you: your family, your faith, your love, your
good health and your friends.

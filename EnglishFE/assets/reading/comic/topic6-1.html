<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">The magician & the parrot</h2>
<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 

A magician was working on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. He has a different audience each week, so he allowed himself to perform the same act over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain’s parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick.
<br/><br/>
Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of every show.
<br/><br/>
“Look, that’s not the same hat!” “Now he’s hiding the flowers under the table!” “Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades?” The magician was furious but couldn’t do anything about it. After all, it was the captain’s parrot. One day the unthinkable happened: The ship had an accident and sank! The magician found himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the ocean with the parrot of course! They stared at each other with hate, but did not utter a single word. This went on for days. After a week the parrot finally broke the silence and said, “Ok, I give up, Where’d you hide the boat?”

A guy is taking a walk and sees a frog on the side of the road. As he comes closer, the frog starts to talk.
<br/><br/>
“ Kiss me and I will turn into a princess.” The guy picks the frog up and puts it in his pocket.
<br/><br/>
The frog starts shouting, “ Hey! Didn’t you hear me? I’m a Princess. Just kiss me and I will be yours!”
<br/><br/>
The guy takes the frog out of his pocket and smiles at it and puts it back. The frog is really frustrated. “ I don’t get it. Why won’t you kiss me? I will turn into a beautiful princess and do anything you ask” The guy says, “Look, I’m a computer programmer. I don’t have time for girls. But a talking frog is cool!”

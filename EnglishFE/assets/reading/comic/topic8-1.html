<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">The carjacking</h2>
<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 
An elderly woman did her shopping and, upon returning to her car, found four males in the act of leaving with her vehicle. She dropped her shopping bags, drew her handgun, and proceeded to scream at them at the top of her voice,
<br/><br/>
“I have a gun and I know how to use it! Get out of the car, you scumbags!”
<br/><br/>
The four men didn’t wait for a second invitation but got out and ran like mad. The woman, somewhat shaken, proceeded to load her shopping bags in the back of the car and get into the driver’s seat. She was so shaken that she could not get her key into the ignition. She tried and tried, to no avail/ And then it dawned on her why. A few minutes later, she found her own car parked four or five spaces father down. She loaded her bags into her car and drove to the police station. The sergeant, to whom she told the story, nearly tore himself in two the other end of the counter, where four pale males were reporting a carjacking by a mad elderly woman described as white, less than five feet tall, glasses, curly white hair, and carrying a large handgun. No charges were filed.

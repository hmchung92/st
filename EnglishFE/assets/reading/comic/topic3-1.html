<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">The office rules</h2>
<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 
Bill Jenkins worked in a big office in the city, and generally he used to go to the barber’s during working hours to have his hair cut, although this was against the rules: clerks had to have their hair cut in their own time.
<br/><br/>
While Bill was at the barber’s one day, the manager of the office came in by chance to have his own hair cut. Bill saw him and tried to hide his face, but the manager came and sat beside him, so he soon recognized him.
<br/><br/>
“Hullo, Jenkins,” the manager said. “I see that you are having your hair cut in office time,”
<br/><br/>
“Yes, sir, I am,” admitted Bill calmly. “You see, sir, it grows in office time.”
<br/><br/>
“Not all of it,” said the manager of the office at once. “Some of it grows in your own time.”
<br/><br/>
“Yes, sir, that’s quite true” answered Bill politely, “but I’m not having it all cut off.”

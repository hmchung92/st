<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 
A man was telling one of his friends the secret of his contented married life.
<br/><br/>
“My wife makes all the small decisions,” he explained. “and I make all the big ones, so we never interfere in each other’s business and never get annoyed with each other. We have no complains and no arguments.
<br/><br/>
“That sounds reasonable,” answered his friend sympathetically, “And what sort of decisions does your wife make?” “Well” answered the man. “she decides what jobs I apply for, what sort of house we live in, what furniture we have, where we go for your holidays, and things like that.” His friend was surprised. “Oh!” he said “ And what do you consider important decisions then?” “Well” answered the man, “ I decide who should be Prime Minister, whether we should increase our help to poor countries, what we should do about the atom bomb, and things like that.”

<font >Nothings Gonna Change My Love For You</font></b><br>
</div><br>
If I had to live my life without you near me<br>
The days would all be empty<br>
The nights would seem so long<br>
With you I see forever oh so clearly<br>
I might have been in love before<br>
But it never felt this strong<br>
Our dreams are young and we both know<br>
They'll take us where we want to go<br>
Hold me now, touch me now<br>
I don't want to live without you<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
One thing you can be sure of<br>
I'll never ask for more than your love<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
The world may change my whole life through<br>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
<br>
If the road ahead is not so easy<br>
Our love will lead the way for us<br>
Like a guiding star<br>
I'll be there for you if you should need me<br>
You don't have to change a thing<br>
I love you just the way you are<br>
So come with me and share the view<br>
I'll help you see forever too<br>
Hold me now, touch me now<br>
I don't want to live without you<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
One thing you can be sure of<br>
I'll never ask for more than your love<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
The world may change my whole life through<br>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
One thing you can be sure of<br>
I'll never ask for more than your love, my love<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
One thing you can be sure of<br>
I'll never ask for more than your love<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
The world may change my whole life through<br>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br>
One thing you can be sure of, sure of<br>
I'll never ask for more than your love, my love<br>

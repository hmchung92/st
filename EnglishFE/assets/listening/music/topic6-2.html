<font >Right here waiting for you</font></b><br>
</div><br>
Oceans apart day after day.<br>
And I slowly go insane.<br>
I hear your voice on the line.<br>
But it doesn't stop the pain.<br>
If I see you next to never.<br>
How can we say forever.<br>
<br>
* Wherever you go, whatever you do.<br>
I will be right here waiing for you.<br>
What ever it takes.<br>
Or how my heart breaks.
<br>I will be right here waiing for you. <br>
I took for granted, all the times.<br>
That I thought would last somehow.<br>
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears.<br>
But I can't get near you now.<br>
Oh, can't you see it, baby.<br>
You've got the boln crazy.<br>
<br>
* Wherever you go, whatever you do.<br>
I will be right here waiing for you.<br>
What ever it takes.<br>Or how my heart breaks.<br>
I will be right here waiing for you. <br>
I wonder how we scan survive.<br>
This romance.<br>
But in the end if I'm with you.<br>
I'll take the chance.<br>
Oh, can't you see it baby.
<br>You've got the goin crazy. <br>
* Wherever you go, whatever you do.<br>
I will be right here waiing for you.<br>
What ever it takes.
<br>Or how my heart breaks.
<br>I will be right here waiing for you. <br>

On a dark desert highway<br>
Cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas<br>
Rising up through the air<br>
Up ahead in the distance<br>
I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim<br>
I had to stop for the night<br>
There she stood in the doorway<br>
I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself<br>
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell<br>
Then she lit up a candle<br>
And she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor<br>
I thought I heard them say<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
Such a lovely place<br>
Such a lovely place (background)<br>
Such a lovely face<br>
Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
Any time of year<br>
Any time of year (background)<br>
You can find it here<br>
You can find it here<br>
<br>
Her mind is Tiffany twisted<br>
She's got the Mercedes bends<br>
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys<br>
That she calls friends<br>
How they dance in the courtyard<br>
Sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember<br>
Some dance to forget<br>
So I called up the Captain<br>
Please bring me my wine<br>
He said<br>
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
Just to hear them say<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
Such a lovely Place<br>
Such a lovely Place (background)<br>
Such a lovely face<br>
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>
What a nice surprise<br>
What a nice surprise (background)<br>
Bring your alibies<br>
<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling<br>
Pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said<br>
We are all just prisoners here<br>
Of our own device<br>
And in the master's chambers<br>
They gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives<br>
But they just can't kill the beast<br>
Last thing I remember<br>
I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
Relax said the nightman<br>
We are programed to recieve<br>
You can check out any time you like<br>
But you can never leave</span><br>

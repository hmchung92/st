</div><br>
Hiding from The Rain and Snow <br>
                        Trying to forget but I won't let go<br>
                        Looking at a crowded street<br>
                        Listening to my own heart beat<br>
                        <br>
                        So many people all around the world<br>
                        Tell me where do I find someone like you girl<br>
                        <br>
                        [Chorus:]<br>
                        Take me to your heart, take me to your soul<br>
                        Give me your hand before I'm old<br>
                        Show me what love is - haven't got a clue<br>
                        Show me that wonders can be true<br>
                        <br>
                        They say nothing lasts forever<br>
                        We're only here today<br>
                        Love is now or never<br>
                        Bring me far away<br>
                        <br>
                        Take me to your heart take me to your soul<br>
                        Give me your hand and hold me<br>
                        Show me what love is - be my guiding star<br>
                        It's easy take me to your heart<br>
                        <br>
                        Standing on a mountain high<br>
                        Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky<br>
                        I should go and see some friends<br>
                        But they don't really comprehend<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't need too much talking without saying anything<br>
                        All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing<br>
                        <br>
                        [Chorus:]<br>
                        Take me to your heart take me to your soul<br>
                        Give me your hand before I'm old<br>
                        Show me what love is - haven't got a clue<br>
                        Show me that wonders can be true

<font >That's why you go away</font></b><br>
</div><br>
Baby won´t you tell me why there is sadness in your eyes <br>
I don´t wanna say goodbye to you <br>
Love is one big illusion I should try to forget <br>
but there is something left in my head <br>
<br>
You´re the one who set it up now you´re the one to make it stop <br>
I´m the one who´s feeling lost right now <br>
Now you want me to forget every little thing you said <br>
but there is something left in my head <br>
<br>
I won´t forget the way you´re kissing <br>
The feeling´s so strong were lasting for so long <br>
But I´m not the man your heart is missing <br>
That´s why you go away i know <br>
You were never satisfied no matter how I tried <br>
now you wanna say goodbye to me <br>
Love is one big illusion I should try to forget <br>
but there is something left in my head <br>
<br>
I won´t forget the way you´re kissing <br>
The feeling´s so strong were lasting for so long <br>
But I´m not the man your heart is missing <br>
That´s why you go away i know <br>
<br>
Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere <br>
Don´t know which way to go <br>
There ain´t so much to say now between us <br>
There ain´t so much for you <br>
There aint´t so much for me anymore<br>

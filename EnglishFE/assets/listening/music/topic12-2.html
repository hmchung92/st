<font >The day you went away</font></b><br>
</div><br>
Well I wonder could it be<br>
When I was dreaming 'bout you baby you were dreaming of me<br>
Call me crazy call me blind<br>
To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time<br>
<br>
Did I lose my love to someone better<br>
And does she love you like I do<br>
I do you know I really really do<br>
<br>
Well hey so much I need to say<br>
Been lonely since the day<br>
The day you went away<br>
So sad but true<br>
For me there's only you<br>
Been lonely since the day<br>
The day you went away<br>
<br>
Oh whoa .... yeah... oh...ooh...<br>
<br>
I remember date and time<br>
September twenty-second Sunday twenty-five after nine<br>
In the doorway with your case<br>
No longer shouting at each other<br>
There were tears on our faces<br>
<br>
And we were letting go of something special<br>
Something we'll never have again<br>
I know, I guess I really really know<br>
<br>
Well hey so much I need to say<br>
Been lonely since the day<br>
The day you went away<br>
So sad but true<br>
For me there's only you<br>
Been crying since the day<br>
The day you went away<br>
The day you went away<br>
The day you went away<br>
<br>
Oh whoa .... yeah oh<br>
<br>
Did I lose my love to someone better<br>
And does she love you like I do<br>
I do you know I really really do<br>
<br>
Well hey so much I need to say<br>
Been lonely since the day<br>
The day you went away<br>
So sad but true<br>
For me there's only you<br>
Been crying since the day<br>
The day you went away<br>
<br>
Why do we never know what we've got till it's gone<br>
How could I carry on<br>
The day you went away<br>
Cause I've been missing you so much I had to say<br>
Been crying since the day<br>
The day you went away<br>
<br>
The day you went away<br>
The day you went away<br>
oh whoa .. yeah oh

<font >My Love</font></b><br>
</div><br>
An empty street,<br>
An empty house,<br>
A hole inside my heart,<br>
I'm all alone and the rooms are getting smaller<br>
<br>
I wonder how,<br>
I wonder why,<br>
I wonder where they are,<br>
The days we've had,<br>
The songs we've sang together(oh yeah).<br>
<br>
And oh my love,<br>
I'm holding on forever,<br>
Reaching for a love that seems so far,<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
So i say a little prayer,<br>
and hope my dreams will take me there,<br>
where the skies are blue to see you once again,<br>
My love,<br>
overseas from coast to coast,<br>
to find the place I love the most,<br>
where the fields are green to see you once again,<br>
my love.<br>
<br>
I try to read,<br>
I go to work,<br>
I'm laughing with my friends,<br>
but I can't stop to keep myself<br>
<br>
from thinking(oh no)<br>
<br>
I wonder how<br>
I wonder why<br>
I wonder where they are<br>
the days we had, the songs we sang together(oh yeah)<br>
<br>
And oh my love<br>
I'm holding on forever, reaching for the love that seems so far<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
To hold you in my arms,<br>
To promise you my love,<br>
To tell u from my heart<br>
What I'm thinking of<br>
<br>
Reaching for the love that Seems so far<br>
<br>
Chorus to end<br>
<br>

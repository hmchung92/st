<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">English</h2>
                        <div>Nomore champagne<br>
                        And the fireworks are through<br>
                        Here we are, me and you<br>
                        Feeling lost and feeling blue<br>
                        It's the end of the party<br>
                        And the morning seems so grey<br>
                        So unlike yesterday<br>
                        Now's the time for us to say<br>
                        <br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        May we all have a vision now and then<br>
                        Of a world where every neighbour is a friend<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        May we all have our hopes, our will to try<br>
                        If we don't we might as well lay down and die<br>
                        You and I<br>
                        <br>
                        Sometimes I see<br>
                        How the brave new world arrives<br>
                        And I see how it thrives<br>
                        In the ashes of our lives<br>
                        Oh yes, man is a fool<br>
                        And he thinks he'll be okay<br>
                        Dragging on, feet of clay<br>
                        Never knowing he's astray<br>
                        Keeps on going anyway...<br>
                        <br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        Happy new year<br>

                        Of a world where every neighbour is a friend<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        May we all have our hopes, our will to try<br>
                        If we don't we might as well lay down and die<br>
                        You and I<br>
                        <br>
                        Seems to me now<br>
                        That the dreams we had before<br>
                        Are all dead, nothing more<br>
                        Than confetti on the floor<br>
                        It's the end of a decade<br>
                        In another ten years time<br>
                        Who can say what we'll find<br>
                        What lies waiting down the line<br>
                        In the end of eighty-nine<br>
                        <br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        May we all have a vision now and then<br>
                        Of a world where every neighbour is a friend<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        Happy new year<br>
                        May we all have our hopes, our will to try<br>
                        If we don't we might as well lay down and die<br>
                        You and I</div>

<font >Yesterday one more</font></b><br>
</div><br>
When I was young<br>
I'd listened to the radio<br>
Waiting for my favorite songs<br>
When they played I'd sing along<br>
It made me smile<br>
<br>
Those were such happy times<br>
And not so long ago<br>
How I wondered where they'd gone<br>
But they're back again<br>
Just like a long lost friend<br>
All the songs I loved so well<br>
<br>
(*) Every Sha-la-la-la<br>
Every Wo-wo-wo<br>
Still shines<br>
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling<br>
That they're starting to sing<br>
So fine<br>
<br>
When they get to the part<br>
Where he's breakin' her heart<br>
It can really make me cry<br>
Just like before<br>
It's yesterday once more<br>
<br>
Looking back on how it was<br>
In years gone by<br>
And the good times that I had<br>
Makes today seem rather sad<br>
So much has changed<br>
<br>
It was songs of love that<br>
I would sing back then<br>
And I'd memorize each word<br>
Those old melodies<br>
Still sound so good to me<br>
As they melt the years away<br>
<br>
Repeat (*)<br>
<br>
All my best memories<br>
Come back clearly to me<br>
Some can even make me cry<br>
Just like before<br>
It's yesterday once more<br>
<br>
Repeat (*)
<br>

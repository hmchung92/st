<font >My heart will go on</font></b><br>
</div><br>
Every night in my dream<br>
I see you, I feel you<br>
That is how I know you go on<br>
<br>
Far across the distance<br>
And spaces between us<br>
You have come to show you go on<br>
<br>
Near, far, wherever you are<br>
I believe that the heart does go on<br>
Once more you open the door<br>
And you're here in my heart<br>
And my heart will go on and on<br>
<br>
Love can touch us one time<br>
And last for a lifetime<br>
And never let go till we're one<br>
<br>
Love was when I loved you<br>
One true time I hold to<br>
In my life we'll always go on<br>
<br>
Near, far, wherever you are<br>
I believe that the heart does go on<br>
Once more you open the door<br>
And you're here in my heart<br>
And my heart will go on and on<br>
<br>
<i><font color="SandyBrown">"There is some love that will not go away"</font></i><br>
<br>
You're here, there's nothing I fear<br>
And I know that my heart will go on<br>
We'll stay forever this way<br>
You are safe in my heart<br>
And my heart will go on and on<br>

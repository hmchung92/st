<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">The subject I consider most important</h2>
<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 
Of all the subjects that I study in school, I think that English is the most important subject. It is mainly through the English language that we gain access to the various sources of knowledge.
<br><br>
English is a language which is spoken and understood by many people in most countries of the world. It is, in fact, the most important means of communication among the vanous countries of the wodd. Knowledge of new discoveries and inventions in one country is transmitted to other countries through English for the benefit of the world. In this way English helps to spread knowledge and progress.
<br><br>
It is true, however, that in the modern age, the study of Science and Mathematics too should be considered very important. Science has conferred many benefits in man. But it requires little thought to realise that scientific principles cannot be understood well without a good knowledge of a language. And, though other languages such as German and Russian are important in the world of Science, it is English that plays the most important role in spreading scientific knowledge. There is in fact no branch of study that has not been communicated in English. The original writings of great scientists, economists, philosophers, psychologists and others who did not speak and write the English language have all been translated into English. Therefore, one who has a good knowledge of English has access to all the sources of information.
<br><br>
Further, as the English language is used by people of different lands and cultures, it has become very rich. It contains so many words, ideas and thoughts that a good knowledge of English enriches the mind and enables one to express oneself well. It also helps one to think better and to understand the people of other lands. It is for all these reasons that I consider English the most important subject in school.

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">The most important day in my life</h2>
<p class="wb-stl-normal"> 
The most important day in my life was the day when my parents decided to send me to school.
<br><br>
I was then about seven years old. I had been playing with the children living around my house for some years. I had no thought of ever going to school. I enjoyed playing to catch fish from the shallow streams near by. Sometimes we went to the forest to catch birds and squirrels, and I had always thought that life would continue to be the same for me. But, one day, to my great sorrow, my parents suddenly announced that I was no longer to play about and that I was to go to a school.
<br><br>
Words can hardly describe how sad I felt at the thought of having to go to a school. I had often heard that school teachers were very strict and cruel. I had also been told that there were many difficult subjects to learn in school and I could not bear the thought of being compelled to learn them. But everything had been decided for me and I had no choice but to go to school.
<br><br>
Soon after I was admitted to school, however, I discovered to my great joy that learning in school was a pleasure. I began to learn about the people and other wonderful things spread throughout the world. The teachers were very kind and friendly and they often told many interesting stories. The subjects that they taught were also very interesting as a result of all this, I began to take a keen interest in my lessons and I no longer wanted to waste my time playing about.
<br><br>
Today, I am older and I am in a secondary school, learning more and more about the world around us. The knowledge that I have gained has enriched my mind and I have a better understanding of human problems. I am also able to speak the English language with some ease, and I know that my knowledge of English will prove of great value in all my future activities. I also know that if I can pass all my examinations, I will some day occupy an important position in some profession. I might even become a minister in the government of my country or a well-known person in some way.
<br><br>
Therefore, when I now think of the day when my parents arrived at the decision to send me to school, I am filled with love for them. That was indeed the most important day in my life, a day which has changed the whole course of my life.
